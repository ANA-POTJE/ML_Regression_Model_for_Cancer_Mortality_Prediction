# ML_Regression_Models_for_Cancer_Mortality_Prediction
CAPSTONE PROJECT

The objective of this project is to compare results between four machine learning regression models
implemented in Python code, and define the one which best predicts a target variable on a given dataset. 
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) approach is to be used to explain the feature correlations of the best model.
The best predicting model is then to be compared with "CausaLens ML Prediction Tool" to determine which model returns best
prediction results as well as the most influential features used for the target prediction.

Scope
“Cancer Mortality Prediction in the US Counties” dataset was provided on the web page:
https://data.world/nrippner/ols-regression-challenge . “TARGET_deathRate” – the target variable – is the mean
per capita (100,000) of cancer mortalities per US county in the period between 2010 and 2016 (or 2013 Census
Estimates). This dataset contains 3,047 rows and 34 features for each of the US counties for this period, which
are described in the document “Capstone Project CausaLens - Ana Potje – APPENDIX”.
